Open science data collection
============================

Personal collection (storage) of various scientific and educational data software inputs and some outputs.

My areas of interest are theoretical chemistry, air pollution modeling and computer science. This collection is open and is used mainly for mz teaching purposes.

Each subdirectory should contain brief description file.
