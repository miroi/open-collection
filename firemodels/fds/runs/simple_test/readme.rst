Simple Test
===========

Sample input files are included as part of the standard installation. 
A good case for a first time user is located in the subfolder called Fires within the folder called Examples. 
Find the file called simple_test.fds and copy it to a folder on your computer that is not within the installation folder.
The reason for doing this is to avoid cluttering up the installation folder with a lot of output files
