Adsorption with ASE
===================

Some examples of adsorptions of chemical systems on some surfaces.
Among them, gold is beeing used as detector cover in experimental synthesis of superheavy elements.

Simple atomistic modeling with "Atomic Simulation Environment" (ASE) can estimate adsorption energies and even adsorption enthalpies of ane adsorbate.

ASE atomistic computations are based upon simple interatomic potentials like Lennard-Jonnes (LJ), but also on machine learnt interatomic potentials (MLIP).
