===================
Adsorption with ASE
===================

Interatomic potentials based computations of some chemical systemts adsorption energies on gold and other surfaces.

Gold surface is beeing used as detector cover in experimental  synthesis of superheavy elements.

Simple atomistic modeling with Atomic Similulation Environment (ASE) can predict estimations of adsorption energies and even adsorption enthalpies of atoms.
