Interatomic potentials based computations of atomic adsorption energies on gold surfaces

Gold surface is beeing used as detector cover in experimental  synthesis of superheavy elements.

Simple atomistic modeling with Atomic Similulation Environment (ASE) can predict adsorption energies and even adsorption enthalpies of atoms.
