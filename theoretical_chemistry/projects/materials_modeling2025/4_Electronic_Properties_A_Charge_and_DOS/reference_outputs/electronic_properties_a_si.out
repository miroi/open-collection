6. Organizing PDOS files from NSCF...
  PDOS files moved to pdos_results directory

7. Verifying TDOS vs summed PDOS (ONLY below Fermi level)...
  Fermi level from NSCF calculation: 6.3215 eV
    Integrated TDOS: 7.9999 states
    Integrated sum of PDOS: 7.9292 states
  Relative difference in integrated DOS: 0.88%
  Maximum pointwise difference: 3.28%
  Excellent agreement (<5% integral difference)
