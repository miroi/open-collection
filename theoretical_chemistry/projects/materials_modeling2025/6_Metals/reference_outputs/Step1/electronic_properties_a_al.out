7. Verifying TDOS vs summed PDOS (ONLY below Fermi level)...
  Fermi level from NSCF calculation: 7.9692 eV
    Integrated TDOS: 2.9966 states
    Integrated sum of PDOS: 2.9528 states
  Relative difference in integrated DOS: 1.46%
  Maximum pointwise difference: 5.87%
  Excellent agreement (<5% integral difference)
