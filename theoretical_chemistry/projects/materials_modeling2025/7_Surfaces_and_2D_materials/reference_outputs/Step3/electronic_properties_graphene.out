6. Organizing PDOS files from NSCF...
  PDOS files moved to pdos_results directory

7. Verifying TDOS vs summed PDOS (ONLY below Fermi level)...
  Fermi level from NSCF calculation: -4.2408 eV
    Integrated TDOS: 6.8057 states
    Integrated sum of PDOS: 6.7393 states
  Relative difference in integrated DOS: 0.97%
  Maximum pointwise difference: 2.19%
  Excellent agreement (<5% integral difference)
