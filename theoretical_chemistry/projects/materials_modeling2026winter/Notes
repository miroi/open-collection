Al: retrieved from from the Materials Project https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-134 for single-shot calculations

Pseudo potential: 
scalar-relativistic optimised norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudo potential files can be downloaded from (https://www.pseudo-dojo.org/), and are also suppiled. 

DOS Plotting scripts provided:
ase_qe_np_tdos.py and ase_qe_np_pdos.py - for plotting TDOS and PDOS, works only for non-spin-polarized and non-SOC case. They expect the files to be organized in a certain order and local sumpdos.x must be supplied if needed.  

For converting crystal structures to QE format, various online/ offline tools can be used.
1) https://qeinputgenerator.materialscloud.io/ 
2) https://seekpath.materialscloud.io/ 
3) VESTA
4) ASE

Quantum ESPRESSO basics

The input file for PWscf is structured in a number of NAMELISTS and
INPUT CARDS.
&NAMELIST1 ... /
&NAMELIST2 ... /
&NAMELIST3 ... /
INPUT_CARD1
....
....
INPUT_CARD2
....
....

NAMELISTS are read in a specific order
NAMELISTS that are not required are ignored
Logically independent INPUT_CARDS can be given in any order

There are three mandatory NAMELISTS
	&CONTROL input variables that control the flux of the calculation and the amount of I/O on disk and on the screen.
	&SYSTEM input variables that specify the system under study.
	&ELECTRONS input variables that control the algorithms used to reach the self-consistent solution of KS equations for the electrons.
We will also need:
	&IONS needed when ATOMS MOVE! IGNORED otherwise !
	&CELL needed when CELL MOVES! IGNORED otherwise !

There are three mandatory INPUT_CARDS
	ATOMIC_SPECIES name, mass and pseudopotential used for each atomic species present in the system
	ATOMIC_POSITIONS type and coordinates of each atom in the unit cell
	K_POINTS coordinates and weights of the k-points used for BZ integration
We will also need:
	CELL_PARAMETERS

Details about input parameters can be found here: 
https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PW.html

https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PROJWFC.html (orbital ordering)
https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_BANDS.html

For running jobs, the pseudopotential file must be in the job directory (or you have to specify the path).

The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a powerful Python toolkit designed for atomistic simulations, offering capabilities for setup, execution, analysis, and visualization. Its key advantages include:

	(1) Streamlining complex, multistep computational workflows
	(2) Enabling hybrid calculations by combining outputs from different codes (e.g., using Quantum ESPRESSO for DFT energies/forces while incorporating DFT-D4 for van der Waals corrections)
	(3) Supporting interoperability with numerous electronic structure codes and force fields

The framework provides researchers with a unified interface for diverse simulation tasks while maintaining flexibility in method combinations.

Challenge Tasks:
1) Find different pseudopotentials from http://pseudopotentials.quantum-espresso.org/legacy_tables or other resources. Update the convergence Test (ASE) python code, and run the convergence test for each. Make a table of energy and k point cut offs of various pseudopotentials using Si as an example.  
2) Modify the TASK 3: Cell relaxation (QE and ASE), use a custom, tighter etot_conv_thr and forc_conv_thr, shift the atoms manually and run the convergence again. try the same in ASE.
3) Modify the TASK 4 electronic properties a script and test the effects of different values of Gaussian broadening (degauss) 
4) Find an experimental Al structure from databases, run convergence test and cell relaxation. Then recalculate the electronic properties using the relaxed unit cell and optimized cut off and k points.
