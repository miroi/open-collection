python hg_se.py > logfile

Program systematicaly scans all surface positions on frozen Se54(100) slab, places Hg atom there and optimizes the geometry.

After scanning all the positions if finds out the most suitable - that is the global minima of Hg@Se54(100) system.
All energies are stored in the file adsorption_summary.txt . 

The program creates subdirectries with optimized geometries, and also with optimization trajectories.
