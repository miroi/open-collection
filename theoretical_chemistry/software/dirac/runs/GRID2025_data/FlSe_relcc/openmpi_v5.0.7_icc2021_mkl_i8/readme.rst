FlSe with DIRAC RelCC
=====================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A request was made to bind that would require binding
processes to more cpus than are available in your allocation:

   Application:     /lustre/home/user/m/milias/DIRAC_scratch_directory/milias/DIRAC_x2c-ach0.scf_relcc_m3.20-vir50.00_FlSe.dyall_acv3z_lsym_59814/dirac.x
   #processes:      6
   Mapping policy:  BYCORE
   Binding policy:  CORE

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
