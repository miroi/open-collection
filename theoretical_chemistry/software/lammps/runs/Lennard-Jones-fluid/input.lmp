# PART A - ENERGY MINIMIZATION
# 1) Initialization

units lj # Lennard-Jones (LJ) units are a dimensionless system of units.

dimension 3 # 3D simulation

atom_style atomic  


# atoms will be interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential with a cut-off equal to rc=2.5 :
pair_style lj/cut 2.5 

# the periodic boundary conditions will be used along all three directions of space (the 3 p stand for x, y, and z, respectively).
