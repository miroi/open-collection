Understanding the data is a crucial part of fitting an MLIP. In this application, we will develop an MLIP for molecular liquids of carbonates. The data presented here is a subset from this work and comprises a mixture of 6 different types of molecules: cyclic carbonates (Vinylene carbonate VC, Ethylene carbonate EC, Propylene carbonate PC) and linear carbonates (Dimethyl carbonate DMC, Ethyl Methyl Carbonate EMC, Diethyl carbonate DEC). Mixtures of these molecules in various formulations are used as solvents in Li-ion battery electrolytes.

getting errors... needs fix to the newest version!!
