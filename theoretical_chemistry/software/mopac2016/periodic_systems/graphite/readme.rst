===================
Graphite with MOPAC
===================

The recommended Large Unit Cell size is 5x7x7, but the BRZ file for that system is large (185 Mb), so, as a placeholder, the file "Graphite (3,5,5).brz" is provided.  This file will allow all the functions described in "Band Structure for Graphite" to be demonstrated, however the results will not be as accurate as when "Graphite (5,7,7).brz" is used.

"Graphite (5,7,7).brz" can be generated by running "Graphite (5,7,7).mop"
