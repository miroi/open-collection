A request was made to bind that would require binding
processes to more cpus than are available in your allocation:

   Application:     /zfs/scratch/HybriLITWorkshop2025/milias/software/orca/orca-6.1.0-f.0_linux_x86-64/bin/orca_startup_mpi
   #processes:      4
   Mapping policy:  BYCORE
   Binding policy:  CORE

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
