 I am in /home/mirilias/work/software/quantum_espresso/gpu-qe-6.8/q-e-qe-6.8/dev-tools
 running python get_device_props.py :


 This is a helper tool to check the details of your GPU before configuring QE.


Remeber to load CUDA environemt and run this on the COMPUTE NODE
if you are not sure that the frontend node shares
the same configuration as the backend nodes


Yaml not available. Printing minimal info.

Compute capabilities for dev 0: 6.0

 If all compute capabilities match, configure QE with:
./configure --with-cuda=yes --with-cuda-cc=60 --with-cuda-runtime=11.0
